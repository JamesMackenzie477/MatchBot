The program's settings can be configured in the MatchCracker.py file.

The verbose mode will print general debug information to the standard output stream, please keep this enabled if you need to find an error.

Please ensure that you use ONLY american proxies for this cracker, if a proxy located somewhere other then american is used then the results of the cracker become unpredictable.

The cracker does not employ the use of proxy checking, this is up to you to do.
